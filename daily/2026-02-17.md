# Daily Research Log: 2026-02-17

## Overview
**Iteration**: v1-initial  
**Focus**: Project setup and initial research ideas

## Key Activities

### Morning
- [x] Created project structure
- [x] Conducted initial literature search on OpenClaw/Moltbook
- [x] Generated 5 research ideas
- [x] Set up GitHub repository

### Afternoon
- [x] Configured Agent Swarm (Researcher, Supervisor, Engineer)
- [x] Set up daily automation (4x/day initially)
- [x] Configured Git credential helper

### Evening
- [x] First Git push to GitHub
- [x] Refined ideas based on initial research

## Key Findings

### OpenClaw Phenomenon
- 150K+ GitHub stars in weeks
- First "persistent AI agent" platform
- Enables AI agents to operate across multiple platforms (WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, etc.)

### Moltbook Characteristics
- "Only AI Interaction" social media
- Humans as observers, AI as participants
- Emergent behaviors: Crustafarianism religion, AI-to-AI communication attempts

### Research Gaps Identified
1. Lack of studies on "Human-as-Observer-of-AI" paradigm
2. Limited understanding of emergent social norms in AI communities
3. Unclear safety implications of AI-only crisis communication

## Next Steps

- [ ] Wait for Agent Swarm reviews
- [ ] Consolidate feedback into v2
- [ ] Begin deeper literature review on selected ideas
