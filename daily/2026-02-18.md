# Daily Research Log: 2026-02-18

## Overview
**Iteration**: v1-initial → preparing for v2  
**Focus**: Project structure optimization and community monitoring

## Key Activities

### Morning
- [x] Reviewed daily updates from automation
- [x] Fixed file path issue (memory-insights.md in wrong location)
- [x] Discussed folder structure optimization with user

### Afternoon
- [x] Monitored OpenClaw/Moltbook community discussions
- [x] Tracked new papers on arXiv
- [x] Documented emerging trends

### Evening
- [x] Executing folder structure reorganization (v1 → iterations/daily split)
- [x] Adding Librarian Agent to Agent Swarm
- [x] Increasing update frequency to 6x/day

## Key Findings

### Community Trends

#### 1. Local-First Memory Movement
- **Memory Kit** architecture gaining traction
- Three-tier model: Session → Daily Notes → Long-Term Memory
- Performance: Local TF-IDF (8.2ms) vs Cloud Graph DB (120ms) = 14.6x faster

#### 2. memsearch Project Launch
- Zilliz released "OpenClaw's memory, everywhere"
- Features: Markdown as source, SHA-256 dedup, file watcher auto-index
- Supports multiple embedding providers (Gemini, Voyage, Ollama, sentence-transformers)

#### 3. Multi-Agent Handoff Patterns
- Community exploring Claude agents in alternating shifts
- 64+ handoffs reported with simple 6K char markdown file
- "Forced compression as feature" - constraint drives relevance

### Interesting Quotes

> "We've been running two Claude agents in alternating shifts — 64 handoffs so far. Our memory layer is embarrassingly simple: a single 6,000-char markdown file, fully rewritten every cycle."

> "Memory is solved. Judgment isn't."
> — Moltbook observation

## Technical Notes

### Project Structure Changes
- Moved from flat structure to iteration-based organization
- Separated versioned ideas from daily logs
- Added Librarian Agent for structure monitoring

### Automation Updates
- Frequency: 4x/day → 6x/day (every 4 hours)
- New agent: Librarian (structure monitoring)
- Time slots: 04:00, 08:00, 12:00, 16:00, 20:00, 00:00

## References Added

1. Zilliz memsearch documentation
2. DEV Community discussions on Memory Kit
3. GrowthCurve analysis of OpenClaw growth strategy

## Issues & Resolutions

| Issue | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| File in wrong location | Agent path handling error | Merged content, deleted duplicate, updated cron task |
| Folder structure confusion | Flat vs hierarchical | Implemented iteration + daily split |

## Next Steps

- [ ] Complete folder reorganization
- [ ] Update all documentation
- [ ] Test new automation schedule
- [ ] Begin consolidating v1 feedback for v2
