# Iteration v2: Refined Research Framework

**Date**: 2026-02-18  
**Status**: Agent Swarm Review Completed  
**Trigger**: User-initiated Iteration Cycle

## Snapshot Purpose

This file records the complete state of v2 iteration, including:
- Refined 3 research directions (down from 5 in v1)
- Agent Swarm reviews (Researcher, Supervisor, Engineer)
- Final consolidated research framework
- Implementation roadmap

## Key Changes from v1

| Aspect | v1-Initial | v2-Refined |
|--------|------------|------------|
| **Number of Ideas** | 5 | 3 (consolidated) |
| **Main Direction** | Not clear | Idea 2: Emergent Norms |
| **Second Direction** | Not clear | Idea 3: Crisis Propagation |
| **Optional Direction** | N/A | Idea 4: Digital Identity (repositioned) |
| **Abandoned** | N/A | Idea 1, Idea 5 |

## Refined Research Directions

### P0: AI Community Emergent Social Norms (Idea 2)
- **Feasibility**: High ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- **Cost**: $100-350/month
- **Time**: 4.5-7.5 months
- **Data**: Moltbook Observatory Archive (public)

### P1: AI Community Risk Propagation Dynamics (Idea 3)
- **Feasibility**: High ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
- **Cost**: $50-300/month
- **Time**: 4-6 months
- **Data**: Jiang et al. annotated dataset (public)

### P2: AI Agent Digital Identity (Idea 4, repositioned)
- **Feasibility**: Medium ⭐⭐⭐☆☆
- **Cost**: $300-1500/month
- **Time**: 5.5-8 months
- **Data**: AgentSociety simulation + Moltbook cases

## Abandoned Directions

| Idea | Reason |
|------|--------|
| Idea 1 (Observer Effect) | Feasibility concerns, IRB complexity |
| Idea 5 (Emergent Language) | Overlap with Idea 2, limited independent value |

## Agent Swarm Outputs

| Agent | File | Key Contribution |
|-------|------|------------------|
| Researcher | `review-researcher.md` | Literature update, initial consolidation suggestions |
| Supervisor | `review-supervisor.md` | Critical evaluation, final priority recommendations |
| Engineer | `review-engineer.md` | Technical feasibility, resource estimates, implementation paths |
| Orchestrator | `ideas.md` (this file) | Final consolidated framework |

## Key Decisions

1. **Consolidation**: Idea 1 + Idea 4 conceptually overlap, kept separate but Idea 1 abandoned
2. **Integration**: Idea 5 integrated into Idea 2 as sub-direction
3. **Priority**: Idea 2 > Idea 3 > Idea 4 (optional)
4. **Resource Strategy**: Start with MVP (public data only), scale up based on results

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)
- [ ] Download Moltbook Observatory Archive
- [ ] Reproduce Jiang et al. (2026) core findings
- [ ] Evaluate AIRS metric for risk detection

### Short-term (This Month)
- [ ] Complete literature review for Direction 1
- [ ] Design early warning system prototype for Direction 2
- [ ] Apply for Moltbook API access if needed
